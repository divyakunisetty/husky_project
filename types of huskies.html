<h2> SIBERIAN HUSKY</h2>
<p> This pup, who can range from snow white to jet black, is considered high energy, outgoing and loyal to its owner. <br>
Males weigh in at up to 60 pounds while females are about 10 pounds lighter. The eyes are blue or brown, and the thick <br>
coat that wards off the chill in its ancestral environment should be brushed weekly. </p>

 <h2> AlASKAN HUSKY</h2>
 <p> An Alaskan husky isn't judged by his conformation on a show table but by how well he pulls his weight. This is the <br>standard sled dog, a tough mixed breed that weathers the trails and harsh weather conditions in sled and sprint races.<br>
 It's bred by purpose rather than looks. </p>

 <h2> ALASKAN MALAMUTE</h2>
 <p> >The distinctive appearance of the Malamute includes brown eyes and a broad head distantly placed eyes. These huskies <br> have a bushy tail and though powerful, they use sharp paws to dig instead of jumping over fences. This dog loves to <br>
 go on jaunts and can be aggressive with other species, but loyal and caring to his human companions.</p>

<h2> WATERFALLS</h2>
 <p> Yosemite is home to countless waterfalls. The best time to see waterfalls is during spring, when most of the snowmelt occurs. Peak runoff typically occurs<br>
	 in May or June, with some waterfalls (including Yosemite Falls) often only a trickle or completely dry by August. Storms in late fall rejuvenate<br>
	 some of the waterfalls and all of them accumulate frost along their edges many nights during the winter.</p>
